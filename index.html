<!-- one method of adding react in project is via the cdn links 
 cdn links ? A CDN (Content Delivery Network) link is a URL that allows you to include external libraries or assets in your web project directly from a CDN provider. These links host the files on servers distributed globally, which helps with faster load times and reduces the load on your own servers. 
 react = core react file
 react dom = react for handling dom 
 why two files ? beacouse react runs on different platforms hence react dom act as bridge between the react and dom
